# PacMan X

This project is the final assignment for my Computer Graphics course at [UFPB](http://ufpb.br). It is a game with the same look and feel of NAMCO's PacMan, but in 3D, using OpenGL.

All rights are reserved to [BANDAI NAMCO](https://www.bandainamcoent.com)™.

## Prerequisites

- [FREEGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download) - OpenGL Toolkit
- [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org) - Sound Library
- [QT's qmake](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/installation.html) - To compile (see below)

## Compiling and Running

You'll need to run ``qmake`` to create the proper ``Makefile`` for this project, then run ``make`` on the very same directory. The binary file will be named ``pacmanx``.
